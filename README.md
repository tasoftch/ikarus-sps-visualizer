# Ikarus SPS Visualizer
The Visualizer package provides several mechanisms to communicate with a SPS via a web interface.  
It is combined by the Skyline CMS.

```bin
$ composer require ikarus/sps-visualizer
```

It is the SPS-side package to establish communication.  
For the web-side package, use ```ikarus/sps-visualizer-component```.
